Cumulative Rules Mode - Implementation Progress
================================================

[x] Add isCumulativeMode state to plan page
[x] Add Switch toggle to rules-sidebar.tsx (left of magic wand)
[x] Implement cumulative merge logic in use-district-rules.ts
[x] Update plan page to use cumulative merge when applying rules
[x] Update getLastMatchingRuleColor to support cumulative mode
    (No changes needed — already returns last matching rule's color, correct for both modes per PRD)
[x] Update intervention-map.tsx to pass cumulative mode down
    (No changes needed — intervention-map reads from district properties already set by plan page effect)
[x] Update list-view / intervention-table to display merged interventions
    (No changes needed — reads from district.interventionCategoryAssignments already computed correctly)
[x] Update budget-view to compute costs from merged intervention sets
    (No changes needed — reads from district properties already set by plan page effect)
[ ] Test: district matching one rule → same behavior in both modes
[ ] Test: district matching multiple rules → union of interventions in cumulative mode
[ ] Test: category conflict resolution (last-write-wins per category)
