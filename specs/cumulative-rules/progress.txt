================================================

[x] Add isCumulativeMode state to plan page
[x] Add Switch toggle to rules-sidebar.tsx (left of magic wand)
[x] Implement cumulative merge logic in use-district-rules.ts
[x] Update plan page to use cumulative merge when applying rules
[ ] Update getLastMatchingRuleColor to support cumulative mode
[ ] Update intervention-map.tsx to pass cumulative mode down
[ ] Update list-view / intervention-table to display merged interventions
[ ] Update budget-view to compute costs from merged intervention sets
[ ] Test: district matching one rule → same behavior in both modes
