# Colored Table Rows - Implementation Progress

## Tasks

[x] 1. Add rule color lookup utility
      - Create helper function to get the last matching rule for a district
      - Return rule color or null if no match
      - ALREADY EXISTS: getLastMatchingRuleColor() in src/hooks/use-district-rules.ts:153-198

[x] 2. Remove zebra striping from List View table
      - Identify and remove alternating row background styles
      - DONE: Removed `index % 2 === 0 ? "bg-background" : "bg-muted/20"` from intervention-table.tsx:139
      - Also removed unused `cn` import

[x] 3. Apply base background color to rows
      - Add inline style with rule color at 30% opacity
      - Handle null case (no background for unmatched districts)
      - DONE: Added hexToRgba helper (line 48-53), get rule color via getLastMatchingRuleColor,
        apply rowStyle with 30% opacity to each <tr> in intervention-table.tsx:166-180

[ ] 4. Implement hover state
      - Darken row to 45% opacity on hover
      - Apply to entire row uniformly
      - Use 100ms transition

[ ] 5. Implement selection state
      - Darken row to 50% opacity when selected
      - Persist darkened state until deselected
      - No additional effect when hovering selected row

[ ] 6. Add smooth transitions for rule changes
      - 200-300ms transition when rule color is modified
      - Animate fade-out when rule is deleted
      - Smooth transition when district's matching rule changes

[ ] 7. Testing & QA
      - Verify text readability at all opacity states
      - Test with light colors (pale yellow, etc.)
      - Test rule creation, modification, deletion
      - Test hover and selection interactions
      - Verify header row is unchanged
