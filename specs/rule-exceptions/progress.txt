## Status

Current task: Task 22 completed
Last updated: 2026-01-27

## Completed Work

### Task 1: Install shadcn/ui collapsible component
- Installed @radix-ui/react-collapsible dependency via npm
- Created src/components/ui/collapsible.tsx following shadcn/ui patterns
- Exports: Collapsible, CollapsibleTrigger, CollapsibleContent
- Commit: ee6bb1e

### Task 2: Create CollapsibleSection reusable component
- Created src/components/ui/collapsible-section.tsx
- Features:
  - Wraps Radix collapsible primitives in a reusable component
  - Clickable header with title and chevron icon
  - ChevronDown when expanded, ChevronRight when collapsed
  - Hover state styling on the header
  - Props: title, children, defaultOpen (default: true), className
  - ARIA attributes (aria-expanded) for accessibility
- Added collapsible animation keyframes to tailwind.config.ts
  - collapsible-down: 150ms ease-out height animation
  - collapsible-up: 150ms ease-out height animation
- Commit: 03381c5

### Task 3: Wrap Selection Criteria section in CollapsibleSection
- Imported CollapsibleSection component in rule-edit-modal.tsx
- Replaced the Selection Criteria section's outer `<div>` and `<h3>` with `<CollapsibleSection title="Selection Criteria">`
- Section now collapses/expands with animated chevron and smooth height transition
- Commit: 29897ef

### Task 4: Wrap Assign Interventions section in CollapsibleSection
- Replaced the Assign Interventions section's outer `<div>` and `<h3>` with `<CollapsibleSection title="Assign Interventions">`
- Section now collapses/expands with animated chevron and smooth height transition
- Both Selection Criteria and Assign Interventions sections are now collapsible
- Commit: cc2c55e

### Task 5: Add expand/collapse animation (150-200ms)
- Updated CollapsibleSection to use a single ChevronDown icon instead of swapping between ChevronDown and ChevronRight
- Added smooth 150ms ease-out rotation transition to the chevron icon
- Chevron rotates -90° when collapsed (points right) and 0° when expanded (points down)
- This matches the PRD requirement: "Chevron icon rotates 90° when collapsed"
- Content height animation was already in place (150ms ease-out from Task 2)
- Phase 1 (Collapsible Sections) is now complete
- Commit: 8c63b8c

### Task 6: Update SavedRule type with excludedDistrictIds field
- Added `excludedDistrictIds?: string[]` field to the SavedRule interface in src/types/rule.ts
- Field is optional (uses `?:`) to maintain backward compatibility with existing rules
- Added JSDoc comment: "Array of district IDs to exclude from this rule's selection criteria"
- Commit: 442cdd5

### Task 7: Update rule saving logic to persist exceptions
- Added `excludedDistrictIds` state variable to RuleEditModal (useState<string[]>([]))
- When modal opens with existing rule, loads excludedDistrictIds from rule (using ?? [] for backward compatibility)
- When creating new rule, initializes excludedDistrictIds to empty array
- handleSave function now includes excludedDistrictIds in the SavedRule object
- Only includes excludedDistrictIds in saved rule when array is non-empty (to keep data clean)
- Added excludedDistrictIds to useCallback dependency array
- Commit: 5a6ea23

### Task 8: Update rule loading logic to restore exceptions
- Added `excludedDistrictIds` to the rule serialization key in page.tsx
- The useEffect that re-applies rules when savedRules changes now includes excludedDistrictIds in its change detection
- This ensures that when exceptions are added/removed, the rule re-application logic triggers
- Note: The actual modal loading was already implemented in Task 7 (line 195 in rule-edit-modal.tsx)
- Commit: 101fe63

### Task 9: Update rule application logic to exclude excepted districts
- Modified src/app/page.tsx (lines 181-184): After finding matching districts via `findMatchingDistrictIds()`, added filtering step to remove districts present in `rule.excludedDistrictIds`
- Modified src/hooks/use-district-rules.ts: Added exclusion check in `getLastMatchingRuleColor()` function - if a district is in a rule's `excludedDistrictIds`, the rule is skipped when determining the district's color
- Both the map view and list/table view now correctly skip excluded districts when applying rule colors and interventions
- Commit: 787fd1e

### Task 10: Update map view to reflect exceptions
- Verified that the map view already correctly reflects exceptions through the implementation in Task 9
- The flow works as follows:
  1. When savedRules changes (including excludedDistrictIds), the useEffect in page.tsx re-applies all rules
  2. Default rule first resets all districts to baseline color (lines 141-163 in page.tsx)
  3. Non-default rules apply to matching districts MINUS excluded ones (lines 181-184 filter out excludedDistrictIds)
  4. updateDistricts() sets ruleColor on each district's properties
  5. district-layer.tsx renders districts using ruleColor from GeoJSON properties
- Excluded districts revert to their default rule color since they're not included in the rule's district list
- No additional code changes required - Task 9's implementation already handles the map view correctly

### Task 11: Update list view to reflect exceptions
- Verified that the list view already correctly reflects exceptions through the implementation in Task 9
- The list view uses two mechanisms, both of which handle exceptions:
  1. **Row colors**: `getLastMatchingRuleColor()` in intervention-table.tsx (line 172-176) which already checks `excludedDistrictIds` (implemented in Task 9 at use-district-rules.ts:162-165)
  2. **Intervention checkmarks**: Displayed from `district.interventionCategoryAssignments` property, which is set by page.tsx's rule application logic that filters out excluded districts (lines 181-184) before calling `updateDistricts()`
- Excluded districts:
  - Don't get the rule's color (skipped by getLastMatchingRuleColor)
  - Don't get the rule's interventions (filtered out before updateDistricts)
  - Keep the default rule's color and interventions instead
- No additional code changes required - Task 9's implementation already handles the list view correctly

### Task 12: Add Exceptions section placeholder in modal (wrapped in CollapsibleSection)
- Added a new CollapsibleSection titled "Exceptions" in rule-edit-modal.tsx
- Positioned between Selection Criteria and Assign Interventions sections (per PRD)
- Displays empty state message: "No exceptions. All matching districts will be included."
- Shows list of excluded district IDs when exceptions exist (using existing excludedDistrictIds state)
- Added disabled "Add Exception" button with Plus icon (will be enabled in Task 16)
- Commit: 90a5435

### Task 13: Create ExceptionList component with empty state
- Created src/components/intervention-map/rules-sidebar/exception-list.tsx
- Features:
  - Displays empty state message: "No exceptions. All matching districts will be included."
  - Shows list of excluded districts with district names (not just IDs)
  - Remove icon (X) appears on hover with smooth opacity transition
  - Keyboard support: Delete/Backspace to remove focused exception
  - Proper ARIA attributes: role="list", role="listitem", aria-label on remove button
  - Focus ring for accessibility
- Updated RuleEditModal to accept getDistrictName prop
- Added handleRemoveException callback to remove districts from exceptions
- Updated page.tsx with getDistrictName helper function using useCallback
- Passed getDistrictName to RuleEditModal
- Commit: d5d9a64

### Task 14: Create AddExceptionPopover component
- Installed @radix-ui/react-popover dependency via npm
- Created src/components/ui/popover.tsx following shadcn/ui patterns
  - Exports: Popover, PopoverTrigger, PopoverContent, PopoverAnchor
- Created src/components/intervention-map/rules-sidebar/add-exception-popover.tsx
- Features:
  - Popover anchored to "Add Exception" button
  - Search input at top to filter district list
  - Scrollable list of matching districts (max-height: 300px)
  - Width: 280px (per PRD spec)
  - Filters out districts already in exceptions list
  - Empty states for: no matching districts, no search results, all excluded
  - Clicking a district calls onAddException callback and closes popover
  - Proper ARIA attributes: role="listbox", role="option", aria-selected
- Props: matchingDistricts, excludedDistrictIds, onAddException
- Component is ready to be wired up in RuleEditModal (Task 16)
- Commit: 818efa0

### Task 15: Implement district search/filter in popover
- Search/filter functionality was already implemented as part of Task 14
- Features already in place:
  - Search input at top of popover with placeholder "Search districts..."
  - Case-insensitive filtering via `filteredDistricts` useMemo
  - Search query cleared when popover closes or when district is selected
  - Proper empty state: "No districts match your search" when search yields no results
- No additional code changes required

### Task 16: Wire up add exception functionality
- Updated RuleEditModal to import AddExceptionPopover and useDistrictRules hook
- Added `districts` prop to RuleEditModalProps interface (GeoJSON FeatureCollection)
- Added `rulesForHook` useMemo to convert current criteria state to Rule[] format for the hook
- Used `useDistrictRules` hook to compute matching districts based on current criteria
- Added `matchingDistrictOptions` useMemo to convert hook output to format expected by popover
- Added `handleAddException` callback that appends district ID to excludedDistrictIds state
- Replaced disabled "Add Exception" button with AddExceptionPopover component
- Updated page.tsx to pass `districts` prop to RuleEditModal
- Commit: d15fd75

### Task 17: Implement remove exception on hover (X icon)
- Verified that this functionality was already implemented in Task 13 (ExceptionList component)
- ExceptionList component in exception-list.tsx includes:
  - X icon (lucide-react X) that appears on hover via Tailwind `opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100`
  - Click handler that calls `onRemove(districtId)` callback
  - Smooth opacity transition for the icon
  - Proper hover styling with `hover:bg-destructive/10 hover:text-destructive`
  - Keyboard support: Delete/Backspace to remove focused exception
  - Accessibility: `aria-label="Remove [District Name] from exceptions"`
- RuleEditModal already has `handleRemoveException` callback wired to ExceptionList's `onRemove` prop
- No additional code changes required - Task 13's implementation already covers this

### Task 18: Add exceptions state management in RuleEditModal
- Verified that this functionality was already implemented in Tasks 7 and 13
- State management features already in place:
  - `excludedDistrictIds` state variable (useState<string[]>([]))
  - State initialized from rule on modal open (rule.excludedDistrictIds ?? [])
  - State reset to empty array for new rules
  - `handleAddException` callback to add districts to exceptions
  - `handleRemoveException` callback to remove districts from exceptions
  - Exceptions included in SavedRule object on save (only when non-empty)
  - Proper useCallback dependency arrays for both handlers
- No additional code changes required - previous tasks already implemented full state management

### Task 19: Add ARIA attributes to collapsible sections
- Updated CollapsibleSection component (src/components/ui/collapsible-section.tsx)
- Added `aria-controls` attribute to CollapsibleTrigger, referencing content ID
- Used React.useId() to generate stable unique IDs for each section
- Added matching `id` attribute to CollapsibleContent
- Added `aria-hidden="true"` to ChevronDown icon (decorative element)
- Existing `aria-expanded` attribute was already in place from Task 2
- Component now fully compliant with PRD accessibility requirements

### Task 20: Add ARIA attributes to exception list
- Updated ExceptionList component (src/components/intervention-map/rules-sidebar/exception-list.tsx)
- Added `aria-label="Excluded districts"` to the ul element to identify the list to screen readers
- Added `aria-label` to each li element with district name and keyboard hint for removal
- Added `aria-hidden="true"` to the X icon (decorative, the button already has aria-label)
- Refactored to cache districtName in a variable to avoid repeated lookups within map callback
- Existing attributes already in place: `role="list"`, `role="listitem"`, button `aria-label`
- Commit: 5323150

### Task 21: Implement keyboard navigation for exceptions
- Updated ExceptionList component (exception-list.tsx):
  - Added Arrow Up/Down navigation between exception items
  - Added Home/End keys to jump to first/last item
  - Added Enter/Space as alternative keys to remove (in addition to Delete/Backspace)
  - Added focus management after removal: focus moves to next item, or previous if removing the last item
  - Used useRef to track list element for DOM queries
  - Used useCallback for optimized key handler
- Updated AddExceptionPopover component (add-exception-popover.tsx):
  - Added Arrow Down from search input to move focus into list
  - Added Arrow Up/Down navigation between list options
  - Arrow Up from first option returns focus to search input
  - Added Home/End keys to jump to first/last option
  - Added Enter from search input to select first match
  - Added Enter/Space on options to select
  - Added Escape key handling to close popover
  - Focus returns to trigger button after selection or Escape
  - Added activeIndex state to track keyboard focus for aria-selected
  - Added proper ARIA: aria-controls, aria-activedescendant, aria-label on listbox
  - Added visible focus ring on list options
- Commit: 7cac628

### Task 22: Handle edge cases (empty states, large district lists)
- Verified empty states already handled in both components:
  - ExceptionList: Shows "No exceptions. All matching districts will be included." when empty
  - AddExceptionPopover: Shows appropriate messages for:
    - "No districts match the current criteria" (no matching districts)
    - "No districts match your search" (search yields no results)
    - "All matching districts are already excluded" (all available excluded)
- Added virtualization for large district lists in AddExceptionPopover:
  - Installed @tanstack/react-virtual dependency
  - Created VirtualizedDistrictList internal component
  - Uses virtualization when there are 100+ matching districts (VIRTUALIZATION_THRESHOLD)
  - Virtualizer renders only visible items plus 5 overscan items above/below
  - Fixed item height of 36px for consistent scrolling
  - Maintains same keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes as non-virtualized list
  - Callback ref pattern to share listRef between parent and virtualized component
- Commit: f1b5381
